    <h1>Real Price of a Crisp</h1>
    <h2>September – December | 2022</h2>

    <h3>Methodology</h3>
    <p>Technological aspects, tools used, and process description.</p>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This project began as a lighthearted investigation into one of humanity’s simplest culinary pleasures: the humble packet of salted chips. However, what started as a casual curiosity quickly spiraled into a parody of global obsessions with excess, measurement, and the relentless pursuit of exponential growth, where bigger, more, and better often lead nowhere at all.</p>
    <p>I turned my attention to the chip – a seemingly mundane processed food item that, to me, is nothing short of extraordinary. Its aesthetics, texture, and peculiar social function all begged to be dissected. And dissect I did, literally. Armed with calipers, a scanner, and a deep sense of irony, I embarked on my “scientific” mission to measure, catalog, and analyze every crisp in a single packet.</p>

    <h3>Metrology of a Single Crisp</h3>
    <p>For the first time in my artistic practice, I engaged in something utterly ridiculous: creating measurements of a single chip as if it were a rare artifact or celestial object. Each crisp’s diameter was carefully noted, and tools were meticulously scanned to document my process. The results? A catalogue of marginally different circles that amounted to absolutely nothing—and that’s exactly the point.</p>
    <p>This comically obsessive effort culminated in two key visual outcomes:</p>
    <p>1. A large-exposure crisp, magnified and monumentalized like a relic of a bygone era.<br>
       2. A grease photogram, created from the residual oil of the chips, which ironically resembled the cratered surface of the moon, a nod to how trivial details are often elevated to cosmic significance.</p>
    <p>Through this, I aimed to highlight the absurdity of modern exaggeration: the transformation of something as ordinary as a snack into an object of intense scrutiny and inflated meaning.</p>

    <h3>Exhibition Description</h3>
    <p>Navigating the Unseen: A Reflection on Simulations...</p>
    <p>Initially, I envisioned a grand display for this fictional study—perhaps a sterile lab-like setting that would exaggerate its pseudo-scientific nature. However, due to COVID restrictions, I had to scale down my plans. The final presentation focused on isolating the viewer from any pretense of seriousness, emphasizing the idea that neither they nor I could ever fully grasp the true essence of the chip, let alone the absurdity of analyzing it.</p>
    <p>The installation created a playful yet isolating experience, mimicking the detachment often found in academic or scientific environments. It turned my tongue-in-cheek approach into a visual commentary on how we take small, meaningless details and inflate them into profound, often nonsensical, narratives.</p>
    <p>Through the guise of a fictional investigation, it offers a wry reflection on how we assign importance to the unimportant, often losing sight of the bigger picture—ironically, while staring at a grease-stained one.</p>
