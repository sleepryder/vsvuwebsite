        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The “Optical Error” is my bachelor’s
            thesis project, born from a deep
            sense of inquiry that has grown with
            me over the years. These questions,
            rooted in the formation of my identity,
            created significant voids - gaps that
            demanded filling but instead gave rise
            to internal contradictions.
            These discrepancies disrupted any
            sense of equilibrium and obscured
            my understanding of what I truly
            needed.
            My work began as an exploration of
            this paradox, an attempt to capture
            and decode its layers, while
            simultaneously navigating my place
            within it.
            At its core, this project examines
            internal conflicts, visualized through
            optical distortions and errors, with a
            particular focus on the phenomenon
            of identity blending and the
            persistent struggle of
            self-identification, especially in the
            context of voluntary migration.</p>

        </div>

        <p>This endeavor is shaped by personal
            history, which I weave into the realm of
            photographic art and visual media.
            My approach is further enriched by a
            familial legacy: my grandfathers were
            physicists who often mused about the
            blurred boundaries between truth and
            fiction in science. This inheritance
            fuels my fascination with wandering
            myths tied to the history of astronomy,
            as well as the power of montage to
            reframe reality.
            By incorporating these influences, I
            approach the questions of
            self-knowledge and identity not
            through generalized scientific
            observations but through a lens that
            probes the edges of perception.
            Using optical techniques, I engage in a
            dialogue between the physical and
            the metaphorical, exploring how
            distortions, whether of light or
            identity, can reveal hidden truths
            within constructed fictions.</p>

        <h3>Exhibition Description</h3>
        <p>Navigating the Unseen: A Reflection on Simulations</p>
        <p>Throughout my creative journey, I have
            investigated the relationship between
            reality and simulation, authenticity and
            distortion, often through optical
            experiments and archival materials. These
            fragments now coalesce into a single
            narrative, where the viewer becomes
            both an observer and a participant.
            What fascinates me most is crafting
            environments that evoke the sensation of
            discovery, an almost scientific curiosity,
            while subtly nudging individuals toward
            introspection. The installation plays with
            notions of truth and perception, offering
            a space where the audience can question
            their interpretations and, perhaps, find
            resonance with their own internal
            narratives.
            By layering elements of optical science,
            pseudo-archival aesthetics, and
            interactive media, this project not only
            synthesizes my past explorations but also
            pushes me toward new creative
            territories. It’s an invitation to reflect on
            how we construct and deconstruct the
            realities we inhabit - scientific...</p>
